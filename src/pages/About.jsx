          <h4>Project inspiration</h4>
          <p>
            This project was inspired by Google's advanced notes app, Google
            Keep. Using the app you can save several types of notes: Text, Todo
            List, photos, voice recordings and canvas painting.
          </p>
          <h4>Project features</h4>
          <p>
            The user can perform full CRUD operations on each note. Delete edit,
            duplicate, change color and more. The editing feature of the note is
            within inline and allows for a pleasant and intuitive user
            experience.
          </p>
          <h4>Project technologies</h4>
          <p>
            In this project I used React version 18. The whole project was
            written using function components with hooks. The project has a
            front-end service that knows how to accurately handle requests from
            the user and allow for a smooth, fast experience and clean code. To
            manage the state in the app I used REDUX. This is a responsive
            project and is suitable for use on desktop and mobile.
